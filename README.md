# London-Housing-Case-Study
In this case study I will be exploring which boroughs of London have seen the greatest increase in housing prices, on average, over the last two decades? A borough is just a fancy word for district. You may be familiar with the five boroughs of New Yorkâ€¦ well, there are 32 boroughs within Greater London. Some of them are more desirable areas to live in, and the data hypothetically should reflect that with a greater rise in housing prices.
